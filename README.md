# TETRIS--pygame-
Tetris is a tile matching game developed by Alexey Pajitnov in 1984, which became very popular video game at 80s. I have tried design it using pygame library of python.This repository contains the python code for the game.

## Controls: 
 * LEFT and RIGHT Key to move pieces Left and Right respectively.
 * SPACEBAR to rotate the pieces in clockwise direction.

## This is a screenshot of how the game looks.

ps: The code looks horrible but atleast its working :)
